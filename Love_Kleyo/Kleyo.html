            <h2>Hello! I just wanna thank you for always understanding me. I really appreciate you my love. You're always trying your best to acknowledge me eventhough I can't even understand myself. You always reminds me that I'm not alone, you're always being vocal about what you really feel. You reminds always that I am enough.</h2><br>
            <h2>To be honest I feel bad everytime you I hear you cry because of my stupidity. I often forgot things... I'm really sorry, I'm sorry if I'm always busy to the point that I don't have enough time for you anymore. I will try my best to be a good partner for you and to be your first and last love. I'm such a lucky guy to have a girl like you my love.<h2><br>
            <h2>I would love to share experiences and spend the rest of my life with you my love. I love you so much.</h2><br>
